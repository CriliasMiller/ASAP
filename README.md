## 📖 Paper Overview

**ASAP** is a novel framework for **Detecting and Grounding Multi-modal Media Manipulations (DGM4)**.  
It focuses on improving **cross-modal semantic alignment** between images and text to enhance manipulation detection performance.

### 🔍 Key Highlights

- **Large Model-Assisted Alignment (LMA):**  
  Leverages auxiliary textual information (e.g., captions, explanations) generated by large pre-trained models to enhance semantic consistency between modalities.

- **Manipulation-Guided Cross Attention (MGCA):**  
  Enables the model to focus more accurately on manipulated regions via task-specific cross-modal attention mechanisms.

- **State-of-the-Art Performance:**  
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that ASAP significantly outperforms previous methods on multi-modal manipulation detection and grounding tasks.
